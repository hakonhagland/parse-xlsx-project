# Cleanup Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX module

:camel: Open source contribution project :camel:

## Description
- The module seems to have been abandoned in 2016, see [this](https://github.com/doy/spreadsheet-parsexlsx/issues/97) issue.
- Still many contributions and issue have been submitted since that time, so the
module appears to be important for many.


## Aim

- Fix all outstanding issues and pull requests
- Upload a new version of the module to CPAN
- Learn about the XLSX file format
- Have fun :smiley:
- Contribute to the Perl ecosystem

## Source code repository

The work should be done (by submitting pull requests)
to the `main` branch
of
[hakonhagland/spreadsheet-parsexlsx](https://github.com/hakonhagland/spreadsheet-parsexlsx) which
is a fork of the master branch
of [doy/spreadsheet-parsexlsx](https://github.com/doy/spreadsheet-parsexlsx).
